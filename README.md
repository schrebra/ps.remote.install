# ps.remote.install

Remotely install applications on other computers. Here is an example of a simple PowerShell script that can be used to remotely install an application on a computer:


This script takes two parameters: the computer name and the path to the installation file. It first tests the connection to the remote computer, and if the connection is successful, it copies the installation file to the remote computer's temp directory. Then, it uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run the msiexec.exe command on the remote computer, which installs the application.

To use this script, save it to a file with a .ps1 extension, and then run it from the PowerShell command line by specifying the computer name and installation file path as arguments. For example:

Copy code
.\install-application.ps1 -ComputerName "Computer1" -ApplicationPath "C:\Temp\application.msi"
This script is just an example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs and requirements. Additionally, you may need to configure the remote computer to allow remote PowerShell commands, and you may need to provide credentials to access the remote computer. For more information, see the documentation for the Invoke-Command cmdlet and the Test-Connection cmdlet.
